DGA botnet detection and classification 

 

Introduction:  

Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are techniques used by malware authors to dynamically generate a large number of domain names to connect to Command and Control (C&C) servers. These domain names are often difficult to predict and detect using traditional methods, posing a significant challenge for cybersecurity professionals. Detecting and classifying DGA-generated domains are critical for identifying and mitigating potential botnet threats. 

 

Objective:  

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying DGA-generated domains for botnet detection. The model should accurately distinguish between legitimate domain names and those generated by DGAs associated with botnets. 

 

Dataset: 

The dataset comprises a collection of domain names labeled as either legitimate or DGA-generated. 

Sources for the dataset include: 

Legitimate domain names from reputable sources such as the Alexa website ranking. 

Known DGA-generated domain names obtained from threat intelligence feeds, malware analysis, or security research. 

Each domain name is associated with its corresponding label (legitimate or DGA-generated). 

Features may include domain length, character n-grams, entropy, vowel/consonant ratio, lexical features, and potentially others obtained through feature engineering.
